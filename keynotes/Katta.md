#### Bio
Katta Spiel is an FWF Hertha-Firnberg scholar at the HCI Group of TU Wien (Vienna University of Technology), where they work on the intersection of Computer Science, Design and Cultural Studies through the lens of Critical Access. They research marginalized perspectives on technologies to inform interaction design and engineering in critical ways so they may account for the diverse realities they operate in. In collaboration with neurodivergent and/or nonbinary peers, they explore novel potentials for designs, methodological contributions to Human-Computer Interaction and innovative technological artifacts.
