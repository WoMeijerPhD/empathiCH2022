While empathy has been proven effective in forming relationships between designers and users, it remains an open question about integrating empathy at a large scale in the design process with multiple stakeholders having diverse (even contradicting) perspectives.

In this one-day interactive workshop, we will formulate and develop a set of future challenges and strategies for the **Empathy-Centric Design at Scale** research agenda.

We will investigate the role of empathy and the supporting technologies in the design process at scale.

We invite 4-6 page submissions that include position, work-in-progress, provocation, demo, or poster papers in the SIGCHI Full paper format addressing questions such as (but not limited to):

- Which facets of empathy can be elicited in which context?
- How can we embed empathy in different co-design contexts to lead to inclusive solutions?
- How can technologies empower empathy design for various purposes across and within multiple stakeholder groups?
- How can empathy be employed to reach broader communities and gather unbiased data?
- How can we develop or adopt digital tools to elicit empathy at different scales?

We aim to assemble a multidisciplinary professional network that involves people in HCI, AI, social science, design, psychology, and health from universities, companies, non-profit organizations, and government sectors.

Submissions should be submitted via Easychair ([link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=empathich2022)) and will be selected based on novelty, provocativeness, quality, and relevance to the workshop.

Please direct queries to Andrea Mauri (a.mauri@tudelft.nl).

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop, and all participants must register for the workshop for at least one day of the conference.
