While HCI and design research acknowledged the importance of empathy to the design of user-centered technologies and services, there remain open questions about: assessing empathy, its diversity, and related tensions.

In this one-day interactive workshop, we will consolidate existing theories and conceptualization of empathy, coalesce them to form a comprehensive and coherent framework, scrutinize the seams, and examine the overarching attributes of Empathy-Centric Design. This will lead to the formulation of its research agenda.

We invite 4-6 page submissions that include position, work-in-progress, provocation, demo, or poster papers in the [ACM single-column](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) addressing questions such as (but not limited to):

- What *methods* and *measurement* tools can we rely on to assess empathy and their implications?
- How empathy could and should be modeled at different *levels*, e.g., through artificial neural networks?
- How can empathy be *mis-used*, e.g., the design of persuasive systems?

We aim to assemble a multidisciplinary professional network that involves people in HCI, AI, social science, design, psychology, and health from universities, companies, non-profit organizations, and government sectors.

Submissions should be submitted via Easychair ([link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=empathich2023)) and will be selected based on novelty, provocativeness, quality, and relevance to the workshop.

Please direct queries to Wo Meijer (w.i.m.t.meijer@tudelft.nl) or Luce Drouet (luce.drouet@uni.lu).

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop, and all participants must register for the workshop for at least one day of the conference.
