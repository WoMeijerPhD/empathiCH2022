While HCI and design research acknowledged the importance of empathy to the design of user-centered technologies and services, there remain open questions about: assessing empathy, its diversity, and related tensions.

In this one-day interactive workshop, we will consolidate existing theories and conceptualization of empathy, coalesce them to form a comprehensive and coherent framework, scrutinize the seams, and examine the overarching attributes of Empathy-Centric Design. This will lead to the formulation of its research agenda.

- **Assessment of empathy.** What *methods* and *measurement* tools can we rely on to assess empathy and their implications?
- **Diversity and richness of empathy.** How empathy could and should be modeled at different *levels*, e.g., through artificial neural networks?
- **Empathy tensions and abuses.** How can empathy be *mis-used*, e.g., the design of persuasive systems?

Submissions will be selected based on novelty, provocativeness, quality, and relevance to the workshop (i.e., related to Empathy-Centric Design topics and engaging discussion) through a rigorous, double-blind peer review process.

## Important Dates

- Paper submission: **February 23**, 2023
- Notification of acceptance: **March 9th**, 2023
- Workshop day: April 23, 2023


## Submission Format

We are currently exploring options to publish the proceedings of the workshop.

Submissions should be submitted via Easychair ([link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=empathich2023)) and be anonymized according to the [CHI anonymization policy](https://chi2023.acm.org/submission-guides/chi-anonymization-policy/)..

- Submissions should include a 4-6 page manuscript (excluding references) using the ACM Master Article Submission Template (single column). Here you find the templates for [Latex](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip), [Word](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx), and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt).

- Again: manuscripts **need to be anonymized** according to the [CHI anonymization policy](https://chi2023.acm.org/submission-guides/chi-anonymization-policy/).
- If you use latex, please use: ``documentclass [sigconf, review, anonymous] {acmart}``.

## Submission Types

We invited a broad range of different types of papers, including:

- **Research Paper**: novel research on Empathy-Centric Design (i.e., empathy in HCI and related fields)
- **Case study**: research based on real-world experiences on Empathy-Centric Design topics
- **Provocation/Position Paper**: inspiring, controversial, provoking thoughts on Empathy-Centric Design
- **Work-in-progress**: a study, a research project in progress on Empathy-Centric Design topics
- **Demos**: prototypes and new technology concepts that will be tested during the workshop (including a description of what attendees will experience through the demos) related to Empathy-Centric Design topics
- **Pictorials**: visual components (e.g., diagrams, sketches, illustrations, renderings, photographs, annotated photographs, and collages) accompanying text to convey new ideas and contribute to Empathy-Centric Design

## Review Process

All submissions will be selected based on novelty, provocativeness, quality, and relevance to the workshop (i.e., related to Empathy-Centric Design topics and engaging discussion) through a rigorous, double-blind peer review process.

General and Program Chairs will oversee the review process, including establishing a program committee (PC) of past EmpathiCH â€™22 authors and those with expertise in the topic, selecting a minimum of three knowledgeable reviewers for each submission (at least one of which will be a member of the PC), taking decision for conditional paper acceptance or rejection based on the resulting reviews at a formal committee meeting with PC members.

Note: only minor revisions will be accepted, and the submissions will be reviewed within 2 weeks.

## After Acceptance

After acceptance, we will ask the authors to prepare a final camera-ready version and a summary of changes to be reviewed by the program committee before final acceptance. Authors will also be asked to prepare a 4-8 minute video summarizing their work, which we will publish on the EmpathiCH workshop website. One week before the workshop, we will ask the participants to familiarize themselves with the papers and the videos. Additionally, we will invite all authors to join a special Slack channel to facilitate informal communication.

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop, and all participants must register for the workshop for at least one day of the conference.
