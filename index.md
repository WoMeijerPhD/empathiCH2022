# Empathy-Centric Design At Scale

**EmpathiCH** aims to bring together different scholars---including computer scientists, social scientists, designers, psychologists, policy-makers, and practitioners from other disciplines---to share their knowledge, experience, and ideas about working with empathy for large-scale societal impact.
  
The motivation behind this works lies in the necessity of new digital-supported methodologies to design at-scale solutions to societal problems that are balanced, inclusive, and aware of their effect on society.

We aim to investigate how new technologies can support the design **with** and **for** empathy in the following cases:

- **For different purposes.** Solutions to societal problems may take many forms, such as a policy, a service, or a product Depending on the context, the required methods and the supporting technologies in the design processes of these solutions can be very diverse. The characteristics of the design processes needed in these different cases are very diverse, together with the technologies that can be applied. Thus, we need to identify and evaluate the roles of empathy in co-designing these solutions. Which facets of empathy (cognitive or emotional) can be elicited in which context? How can we embed these empathy facets in different co-design contexts that lead to inclusive solutions? How can we develop and use new technologies (e.g., virtual reality, AI, internet of things, and wearable sensors) to facilitate empathy design for various purposes?

- **Across and within multiple stakeholders.**  Societal problems affect a large variety of stakeholders, each with a different set of needs and values. In order to design inclusive solutions, it is important not only for the designers and decision-makers to understand the citizens but also for the people belonging to the same group to understand each other's perspectives. How can new technologies empower creating empathy across and within multiple stakeholder groups? What are the co-design methods that can make different and diverse communities empathize with each other? How can we make different and diverse communities empathize with each other? How can empathy be employed to reach broader communities and gather unbiased data?

- **At different scales.** Solutions can affect society at different scales, such as a policy at the national level, an urban intervention at the city level, or a plan within an organization. Moreover, different scales can have diverse sets of technological and societal challenges. For instance, as the scale becomes larger, reaching out to diverse stakeholder groups (especially underserved communities) and representing different perspectives can be much more challenging. How can we develop or adopt digital tools to elicit empathy at different scales, especially at the large scale that is hard to tackle using tools that were developed to support small-scale design activities?

This full-day virtual-only workshop includes participants' presentations, an inspiring keynote talk, and a panel of experts.
In addition, this workshop will be a living experiment, where all the interactions between the participant will be recorded (e.g., talks, questions, comments), annotated, combined with sensor data from wearable devices, and made public for everyone to access.

Stimulated by this discussion, the expertise, and experiences of the participants will be combined during a participatory session to shape the future of the "Empathy Design at Scale" research agenda.
