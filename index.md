EmpathiCH is a [full-day workshop](/3-program.html) at CHI '23 that includes participants' presentations, [two inspiring keynote talks](/5-keynote.html), and a [panel of experts](/6-panel.html).

Stimulated by this discussion, the expertise, and experiences of the participants will be combined during a participatory session to shape the future of the "Empathy Design at Scale" research agenda.

## Important Dates

- ~~Paper submission: February 23, 2023~~
- ~~Notification of acceptance: March 6th, 2023~~
- ~~Final revision deadline: Friday March 17th, 2023 AoE.~~
- **Workshop day: April 23, 2023**

## Registration

We invite you to register for the workshop using the instructions found [here](/0-registration.html).

## Goal

We believe that there is a need to expand theories, novel assessment methods, and empirical studies to increase our understanding of empathy and support the human-centered design of technologies and services. In particular, we seek to:

- **consolidate** the existing theoretical and conceptual constructs of empathy from diverse domains including Psychology, Social Sciences, Design, and HCI,
- **coalesce** them to form a comprehensive and coherent framework that utilizes empathy as a new dimension of human-factors research and practice,
- **scrutinize** the seams of Empathy-Centric Design, specifically, the scenarios where it may come in conflict with human dignity, societal values and ethical principles (for example, instrumentalizing Empathy-Centric Design for large scale manipulation or abasement), and
- **examine** the overarching attributes of Empathy-Centric Design including its temporality and materiality.
