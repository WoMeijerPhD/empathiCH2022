# Empathy-Centric Design At Scale!

Welcome to the website for the [CHI2022](https://chi2022.acm.org/) workshop **EmpathiCH**!

We aims to bring together different scholars---including computer scientists, social scientists, designers, psychologists, policy-makers, and practitioners from other disciplines---to share their knowledge, experience, and ideas about working with empathy for large-scale societal impact.
  
The motivation behind this works lies in the necessity of new digital-supported methodologies to design at-scale solutions to societal problems that are balanced, inclusive, and aware of their effect on society.

We aim to investigate how new technologies can support the design **with** and **for** empathy in the following cases:

- **For different purposes:** as solutions to societal problems may take many forms, such as a policy, a service, or a product, requiring a diverse set of technologies and methods.

- **Across and within multiple stakeholders:** as societal problems affect a large variety of stakeholders, each with a different set of needs and values. In order to design inclusive solutions, it is important not only for the designers and decision-makers to understand the citizens but also for the people belonging to the same group to understand each other's perspectives.

- **At different scales:** because solutions can affect society at different scales, such as a policy at the national level, an urban intervention at the city level, or a plan within an organization. Each of them presenting a diverse sets of technological and societal challenges. 

This full-day virtual-only workshop includes participants' presentations, an inspiring keynote talk, and a panel of experts.
In addition, this workshop will be a living experiment, where all the interactions between the participant will be recorded (e.g., talks, questions, comments), annotated, combined with sensor data from wearable devices, and made public for everyone to access.

Stimulated by this discussion, the expertise, and experiences of the participants will be combined during a participatory session to shape the future of the "Empathy Design at Scale" research agenda.
