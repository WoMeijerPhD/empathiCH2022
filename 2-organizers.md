## Organizers
<!-- TODO: add photos -->
**Luce Drouet** is a User Experience Researcher and Ph.D. candidate at the University of Luxembourg in the HCI research group. Her work focuses on empathy in service design, in the wider context of user-centered maturity in companies. She experiments with empathic design methods to facilitate sharing customers’ voices with service employees and to reduce silos in organizations. Luce works in partnership with the Luxembourgish Railway Service. (Website: [https://hci.uni.lu/luce-drouet/](https://hci.uni.lu/luce-drouet/))

**Wo Meijer** (main contact) is an industrial designer and Ph.D. candidate at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft, Netherlands). He has a background in Multi-Modal interactions in Virtual Reality with a focus on increasing presence, engagement, and empathy between and among people. His current research is focused on enhancing video as a user research method in order to help designers develop empathy for their users quickly and deeply.

**Aneesha Singh** is an Associate Professor in Human-Computer Interaction at the UCL Interaction Centre. She is interested in the design, adoption and use of personal health and wellbeing technologies in everyday contexts, focusing on sensitive and stigmatized conditions. Her research areas include digital health, ubiquitous computing, multi-sensory feedback and wearable technology. She has previously worked in industry in various roles as a software consultant, and as a technical journalist.

**Thiemo Wambsganss** is a Postdoc. at the Machine Learning for Education Laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). His work aims to leverage methods from Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to provide users, in particular students, with intelligent writing feedback anytime and anywhere they want. In this vein, he studies how to model empathy in human texts and how to provide students with adaptive empathy feedback in peer review scenarios.

**Andrea Mauri** is a Junior Professor at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, affiliated with the Liris Research Lab. His research lies at the intersection of HCI and Data Management. He investigates how to integrate human factors --such as the concept of empathy-- in computational methods to design, develop and deploy data-intensive applications to make them aware of people features, needs, and values.(Website: [https://andreamauri.me](https://andreamauri.me))

**Himanshu Verma** is a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Industrial Design and Engineering at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft, Netherlands). He has a background in HCI, UbiComp and Social Cognition. He is interested in examining the internal mechanisms (comprised of latent, non-verbal and transient social signals) which enable or inhibit interpersonal collaborations, and his current research focuses on modeling reliable proxies of empathy and their broader implications for empathy-centric design.
